## TODOs & Future Goals
- [ ] Implement a per-user locking mechanism that disallows commands from being executed multiple
  times simultaneously. This could be _optional_ or on a per-Action basis somehow.
- [ ] Improve shell command execution and expandable tokens.
- [ ] Write tests which can be run using a bastardized version of the client at compile-time.
